# Webpack vs Rollup

- Rollup has node polyfills for import/export, whereas webpack doesnâ€™t
- Rollup has support for relative paths, whereas webpack does not, so we either use path.resolve or path.join

## Tree Shaking

Tree shaking or dead code elimination means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process.
Utilizing the tree shaking and dead code elimination can significantly reduce the code size we have in our application.
